- all of the normal suggestion commands like suggest, accept-suggestion, and deny-suggestion.

- When a user uses the suggest command, a dropdown menu is sent and asks the user to select a category.
- The list of categories should be in a configuration file.
- When the category is selected, a modal is opened for the user to enter the suggestion.

- The number of the upvotes and downvotes should be said in the embed.
